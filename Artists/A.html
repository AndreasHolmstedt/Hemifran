    <div class="blockL" style="margin-top: 8em;"><h1>Aaron English</h1><img src="../resources/Aaron_English-.jpg" class="newsimg"><p>Seattle based piano man Aaron English has been steadily building a buzz in the US, thanks to 4 self released albums and regular touring throughout the US as a solo artist and with The Aaron English Band.
<br><br>
In 2012, Aaron scored a Top 5 Italian radio hit in Italy with an epic medley reinvention of The Beatles' and Led Zeppelin's classics "Norwegian Wood" and "Kashmir".
<br><br>
Also in 2012, Aaron formed the side project Boombox Séance with Baltimore singer songwriter Victoria Vox. After writing and touring together in the summer and fall of 2012, they released the album ”Boombox Séance”, produced by Geoff Stanfield, in March 2013.
<br><br>
In 2015, Aaron spent 2 music filled months as a record producer, songwriter, performer in East Africa, where he founded International Youth Music Project, a charity that supports music programs at orphanages.
<br><br>
In 2017, Aaron began a four month tour of Europe to promote his solo album ”American [Fever] Dream”.
<br><br>
Aaron is currently releasing a new single and video each month, a project that will culminate in a new album release at the end of 2017.

    <div class="blockR" style="margin-top: 8em;"><h1>Achilles Wheel</h1><img src="../resources/Achilles_Wheel.jpg" class="newsimg"><p>Achilles Wheel is a high energy rock 'n' roll, roots and world music band from Northern California, featuring award winning songwriting played on numerous stringed instruments and the rhythmic earthquake of two full drum sets. In the wake of their breakout performance at the 2012 Kate Wolf Music Festival, the band has been burning up stages all across California, including the Strawberry Music Festival, the legendary Sweetwater Music Hall and a repeat performance at the Kate Wolf Festival in 2013 that is still being talked about.
<br><br>
Their new CD ‘Stones To Sand’ is just being released and fully embodies the exciting musical growth Achilles Wheel is experiencing. Two sold out shows for the release party at the Crazy Horse Saloon in Nevada City on a balmy summer solstice weekend didn’t stop the large crowd of people who couldn’t get in from dancing in the street, since the doors and windows to the club were all open. This enthusiasm for Achilles Wheel ultimately earned them a spot at the 2014 California Worldfest through a ‘fan choice’ vote. And the Strawberry Music Festival also gave the band a call asking them to join the party this September when that festival will re-emerge in it’s temporary new home at the Grass Valley Fairgrounds.
<br><br>
The fiery epicenter of Achilles Wheel’s sound is Jonny Mojo on lead guitar and vocals, surrounded by Paul Kamm and Shelby Snow on rhythm, bass and vocals, and Gary Campus and Mark McCartney on drums and vocals. As original songs go, Achilles Wheel’s are some of the most accessible around and will stay with you long after the excitement of the show is over. These writers have been acknowledged by many of the biggest music festivals in the country including Kerrville, Telluride and Rocky Mtn Folk. Two of their songs, ‘Got A Tattoo’ and ‘Let the Dream Begin’ have been recognized in the ‘Race to TRI’ song contest, which many on the West Coast will recognize as a premier audio-video production studio run by Bob Weir.
<br><br>
So if you love to dance and celebrate life, come see an Achilles Wheel show and make a joyful noise. They’ll be waiting. Peace.....

            <h1>Ad Vanderveen</h1><img src="../resources/Ad_Vanderveen.jpg" class="newsimg"><p>
        Ad Vanderveen has earned a reputation as one of the finest singer songwriters in the contemporary folk and roots genre. Although born a Dutchman, half his family are Canadian and it’s this part of the world his musical roots can be traced to.
<br><br>
Since the days before it was called americana, Ad has been exploring his songwriting muse through a mixture of rock ‘n’ roll, folk and country, working in many bands before finding his own voice as a solo artist in the early 90’s.
<br><br>
Since then, Ad has built up an impressive catalog of more than 20 solo CD’s and numerous side projects, working with many great musicians all over the world such as, Al Kooper, Al Perkins, Leland Sklar, Herman Brood, Flaco Jimenez, Iain Matthews, Eliza Gilkyson, Eric Andersen, David Olney, to  name just a few. 
<br><br>
Recently in 2017, after hearing Vanderveen’s latest album ”Worlds Within”, none other than Van Morrison, invited him as an opening act. Ad Vanderveen ‘s live and record performances have garnered him high praise from critics, as well as from a long list of renowned colleagues.

        <div class="blockR"><h1>Albert & Gage</h1><img src="../resources/Albert_Gage.jpg" class="newsimg">
    
            <p>
            MoonHouse Records is proud to announce the release of "Albert & Gage – Dakota Lullaby (The Songs of Tom Peterson)". This is the sixth CD for the Austin, Texas duo since teaming up in 1997. Christine Albert and Chris Gage will be continuing their active performing schedule throughout the summer to support the release.
<br><br>
Although Albert and Gage are prolific songwriters, for this project they drew entirely from an extensive catalog of undiscovered gems written by Gage’s old friend from Sioux Falls, South Dakota – Tom Peterson. Virtually unknown outside of South Dakota (although he is somewhat of a legend among his peers in the Midwest), Peterson lived for awhile in Nashville but his songs never found the wider audience they deserve. On the liner notes Gage says “I’ve been singing Tom Peterson songs on stages around the world since 1975, but I had to hear 10,000 other songs before I realized just how great Tom’s are.” And Christine mentions that listening to old recordings of Tom’s music made her feel like she had “just struck gold in the Black Hills”. You can hear the affection and reverence that Albert and Gage have for the songs and for Mr. Peterson himself. Tom Peterson makes his home in Sioux Falls and works in production for a local television news program.
<br><br>
Gage’s multi-instrumental chops are well known through his work as a producer and a sideman (Roy Clark, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Jerry Jeff Walker) and he guides a world class band through classic Americana style arrangements on Dakota Lullaby. He shines on guitars, piano, organ, and dobro and that distinctive Albert and Gage harmony is prominently featured throughout. The duo take turns singing lead and you can almost hear the prairie wind as they wrap their voices around the ballads, the blues, the country, swing and bluegrass that grace this album. The music is pure Americana and Albert and Gage deliver it with the integrity and care that these great songs deserve.
<br><br>
Austin’s studio A-list, Paul Pearcy, David Carroll and Glenn Fukunaga, make up the rhythm section and are joined here by other hot Austin players - Lloyd Maines on pedal steel, John Mills on saxophone and Michael Austin on clarinet. Chris and Christine took advantage of borderless digital technology and added Canadian Mike Stevens on harmonica and South Dakotans Kenny Putnam on fiddle and Boyd Bristow on harmony vocals.
