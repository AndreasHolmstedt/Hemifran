<br><br><br>
"Neila Dar’s sound brings unity to the complexity of reality, using music as a medium to describe it in the simplest way, the soothing textures, enchanting vocals, and captivating grooves give birth to a sound they call vintage avantgarde, where the known and the unpredictable sit together in consonance."

”Very, very pleasing 10 track smooth jazz album from US trombonist, composer, arranger and band leader Geoff Alpert, it’s is debut solo release, and judging by the quality of the music this man makes here, doubtfully his last.”

<br><br>
“The sound of Geoff Alpert‘s trombone in the 10 laid back played, jazzy tracks on his album ‘Open Your Heart’ will give you a feeling and mood of relaxation and joy. There are 2 excellent, into jazz, converted covers on this record with Michael Jackson’s song ‘Heartbreak Hotel’ and the 70's hit song ‘Don’t Ask My Neighbors’ from soul sisters trio The Emotions.“

 <a class="link" href="http://www.google.com">- Duncan Warwick / Country Music People -</a>
<br><br>
"Lesley Kernochan has the looks of a joyful and happy person, but on her latest album, 'A Calm Sun', she explores country and folk songs in which the lyrics are ranging from very serious to joyful, heartfelt emotional and intensely sad, her voice reminds me of other female country stars like Eilen Jewell and Tift Merritt, a comparison that Lesley will for sure be happy about, she deserves a permanent place amongst such top artists and she will hopefully stick to this lovely music style."
